# Radiant

[![Build Status](https://github.com/CBienvenue/Radiant.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/CBienvenue/Radiant.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation-stable-blue.svg)](https://cbienvenue.github.io/Radiant.jl/)

Radiant is a package that performs deterministic transport of ionizing radiation in matter. It specializes in the coupled transport of photons, electrons, and positrons with kinetic energies between 1 keV and 900 MeV.

## Installation

For [Installation Instructions](https://cbienvenue.github.io/Radiant.jl/quick_start/), please refer to the User's Guide.

## Documentation

For a detailed account of the theory and the features of the Radiant package, please refer to the [Documentation](https://cbienvenue.github.io/Radiant.jl/).
